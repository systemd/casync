Description
-----------

Content-Addressable Data Synchronization Tool

Commands
--------

| **casync** **make** [*ARCHIVE* | *ARCHIVE_INDEX*] [*DIRECTORY*]
| **casync** **make** [*BLOB_INDEX*] *FILE* | *DEVICE*

This will create either a .catar archive or an .caidx index for for the given
*DIRECTORY*, or a .caibx index for the given *FILE* or block *DEVICE*. The type
of output is automatically chosen based on the file extension (this may be
overridden with ``--what=``). *DIRECTORY* is optional, and the current directory
will be used if not specified.

When a .caidx or .caibx file is created, a .castr storage directory will be
created too, by default located in the same directory, and named
``default.castr`` unless configured otherwise (see ``--store=`` option).

The metadata included in the archive is controlled by the ``--with-*`` and
``--without-*`` options.

|
| **casync** **extract** [*ARCHIVE* | *ARCHIVE_INDEX*] [*DIRECTORY*]
| **casync** **extract** *BLOB_INDEX* *FILE* | *DEVICE*

This will extract the contents of a .catar archive or .caidx index
into the specified *DIRECTORY*, or the contents specified by *BLOB_INDEX*
to the specified *FILE* or block *DEVICE*. *DIRECTORY* may be omitted,
and the current directory will be used by default.

The metadata replayed from the archive is controlled by the ``--with-*`` and
``--without-*`` options.

|
| **casync** **list** [*ARCHIVE* | *ARCHIVE_INDEX* | *DIRECTORY*]

This will list all the files and directories in the specified .catar
archive or .caidx index, or the directory. The argument is optional,
and the current directory will be used by default.

The output includes the permission mask and file names::

  $ casync list /usr/share/doc/casync
  drwxr-xr-x
  -rw-r--r-- README.md
  -rw-r--r-- TODO

|
| **casync** **mtree** [*ARCHIVE* | *ARCHIVE_INDEX* | *DIRECTORY*]

This is similar to **list**, but includes information about each entry in the
key=value format defined by BSD mtree(5)::

  $ casync mtree /usr/share/doc/casync
  . type=dir mode=0755 uid=0 gid=0 time=1500343585.721189650
  README.md type=file mode=0644 size=7286 uid=0 gid=0 time=1498175562.000000000 sha256digest=af75eacac1f00abf6adaa7510a2c7fe00a4636daf9ea910d69d96f0a4ae85df4
  TODO type=file mode=0644 size=2395 uid=0 gid=0 time=1498175562.000000000 sha256digest=316f11a03c08ec39f0328ab1f7446bd048507d3fbeafffe7c32fad4942244b7d

|
| **casync** **stat** [*ARCHIVE* | *ARCHIVE_INDEX* | *DIRECTORY*] [*PATH*]

This will show detailed information about a file or directory *PATH*, as found
in either *ARCHIVE* or *ARCHIVE_INDEX* or underneath *DIRECTORY*. Both arguments
are optional. The first defaults to the current directory, and the second
the top-level path (``.``).

Example output::

  $ casync stat .
      File: .
      Mode: drwxrwxr-x
  FileAttr: ----------
   FATAttr: ---
    Offset: 0
      Time: 2017-07-17 22:53:30.723304050
      User: zbyszek (1000)
     Group: zbyszek (1000)

|
| **casync** **digest** [*ARCHIVE* | *BLOB* | *ARCHIVE_INDEX* | *BLOB_INDEX* | *DIRECTORY*]

This will compute and print the checksum of the argument.
The argument is optional and defaults to the current directory::

  $ casync digest
  d1698b0c4c27163284abea5d1e369b92e89dd07cb74378638849800e0406baf7

  $ casync digest .
  d1698b0c4c27163284abea5d1e369b92e89dd07cb74378638849800e0406baf7

|
| **casync** **mount** [*ARCHIVE* | *ARCHIVE_INDEX*] *PATH*

This will mount the specified .catar archive or .caidx index at the
specified *PATH*, using the FUSE protocol.

|
| **casync** **mkdev** [*BLOB* | *BLOB_INDEX*] [*NODE*]

This will create a block device *NODE* with the contents specified
by the .caibx *BLOB_INDEX* or just the file or block device *BLOB*,
using the NBD protocol.

Example::

  $ sudo casync -v mkdev README.md
  Attached: /dev/nbd0

  (in another terminal)
  $ sudo head -n1 /dev/nbd0
  # casync — Content Addressable Data Synchronizer

When ``casync mkdev`` is killed, the device is destroyed.

|
| **casync** **gc** *ARCHIVE_INDEX* | *BLOB_INDEX* ...

This will remove all chunks that are not used by one of the specified indices
(one or more blob and archive indices can be given). If ``--store`` is not
given, the default store for the first index will be used.

This command can be used to prune unused chunks from a shared chunk
store.

Turn on archive feature sets:

To turn archive features *off*, ``--without=…`` may be used, such as
``--without=fat-attrs``, ``--without=privileged``, etc.
To disable all optional features, ``--without=all`` may be used.
(The positive form ``--with=all`` does not make sense, because some
features are conflicting. To enable the maximum set of information, use
``--with=best``.)

Archive features
----------------

The various ``--with=`` and ``--without=`` parameters control the precise set
of metadata to store in the archive, or restore when extracting. These flags
only apply if ``casync`` operates on the file system level.

Excluding Files and Directories from Archiving
----------------------------------------------

When generating an archive or index from a file system directory tree, some
files and directories are excluded by default and others may optionally be
excluded:

1. Files and directories of virtual API file systems exposed by the kernel
   (i.e. procfs, sysfs, cgroupfs, devpts … — but not tmpfs/devtmpfs) are
   excluded unconditionally.

2. Depending on whether symlinks, device nodes, fifos and sockets are enabled
   for archiving with ``--with=`` and ``--without=``, file nodes of these types
   are excluded.

3. By default, files and directories with the ``+d`` chattr(1) flag set are
   excluded, however this behaviour may be turned off with
   ``--exclude-nodump=no``.

4. Optionally, files and directories contained in submounts of the specified
   file system tree are excluded, if ``--exclude-submounts=yes`` is specified.

5. By default, any files and directories listed in ``.caexclude`` files in the
   file hierarchy are excluded, however interpretation of these files may be
   turned off with ``--exclude-file=no``. These files operate similar to
   ``git``'s ``.gitignore`` concept: they are read as text file where each line
   is either empty/starts with ``#`` (in which case they have no effect, which
   may be used for commenting), or list a globbing path pattern of
   files/directories to ignore. If a line contains no ``/`` character the line
   applies to the directory the ``.caexclude`` file is located in as well as
   all child directories of it. If it contains at least one ``/`` character it
   is considered stricly relative to the directory the ``.caexclude`` file is
   located in. ``.caexclude`` files may appear in any directory of the file
   system tree that is archived, however they have no effect when placed in
   directories that are marked for exclusion via ``.caexclude`` files placed
   further up in the directory tree. When a line ends in a ``/`` character it
   applies to directories only, and not regular files or other file node
   types. If a line is prefixed with a ``!`` character matching files are
   excluded from the exclusion, i.e. the effect of other matching lines that
   are not prefixed like this is cancelled for matching files. ``!`` lines
   unconditionally take precedence over lines not marked like this. Moreover,
   lines prefixed with ``!`` also cancel the effect of patterns in
   ``.caexclude`` files placed in directories further up the tree.
